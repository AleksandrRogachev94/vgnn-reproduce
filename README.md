# Implementation of "Variationally Regularized Graph-based Representation Learning for Electronic Health Records" model (VGNN)

TODO write good README

This repository contains an implementation of VGNN model described in the [Variationally Regularized Graph-based Representation Learning for Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03761) paper.
The intent is to reproduce ther results.

## Training
Open train.ipynb in google colab and follow instruction in the notebook
